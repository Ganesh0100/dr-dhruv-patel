                                    <p>Arthroscopy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure used to diagnose and treat a variety of joint problems. It involves the use of a small, flexible instrument called an arthroscope, which is inserted into the joint through tiny incisions. This allows the surgeon to visualize the joint's interior on a screen and perform surgical procedures with minimal damage to surrounding tissues. Arthroscopy is commonly performed on the knee, shoulder, hip, ankle, and wrist joints. Here's an overview of arthroscopy surgery:</p>
